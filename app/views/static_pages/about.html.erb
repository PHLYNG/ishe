      Ishé (pronounced ee-CHAY) is the Ifé (ee-fay) word for work. Accordingly, the purpose of this app is to get people to work.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Have you ever walked, ran, biked, driven or generally passed by something in your community that you feel could be better, something that could be improved? Did you say to yourself, "someone should do something about that?" By using Ishé, you become that someone. The power really does "become yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's how it works. Let's say you walk past a pothole in the road. You've driven over that pothole before and it almost took out your rear axle the other day. You called city services but they might get to it sometime in the next 1-18 months. So what do you do?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 1 - Log into Ishé.</li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Step 2 - Create a new Project of type "Pothole", enter the cross-streets and take a picture.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Step 3 - Was a new Project created or were you added onto a Project created by someone else? See? You're not the only one who wants to fix-up your community!
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Step 4 - Once enough people have joined your Project (the only way to join a Project is by creating a new one), you will receive an email with an Action Date and Time.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Step 5 - Fix the Pothole with your Team.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Don't know how to fix a Pothole, or Plant a Tree, or Paint something? Don't worry we'll provide you instructions and a list of necessary and recommended materials, all that you have to do is take action so get out there and Build Your Community!
